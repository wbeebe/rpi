# CMake Tutorial

This is a fairly close copy of a CMake Tutorial found at
https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/tree/master/Help/guide/tutorial/Complete/MathFunctions
with tweaks for Raspbian Buster and CMake version 3.13.4.
CMake 3.13.4 is the version that ships with the current Raspbian Buster
as of September 2019.

The license is the boilerplate Apache 2.0 license with an explicit copyright.
